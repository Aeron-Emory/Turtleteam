# directions 
# Once your concept has been approved by your instructor you can begin # constructing the final program.
# Your program needs to contain the following:
### A main() function that will call other functions.
### A single loop.
### A nested loop.
### A multi-alternative IF structure.
### An input statement either using an input box or input within the program # using an input()
